# IT Logger
The app creates logs and technicians to manage their jobs easily.

## Technical Details
For backend i used `json-server` i didn't wanted to build a real backend for this app. For frontend i used React hooks, Redux for store management and Materialize desing.

## How to Run
#### For backend
- You don't have to do anything because of `json-server`.

#### For frontend
- Run `yarn`
- And go with `yarn dev`. Voil√† app is running :metal:
